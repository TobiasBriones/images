### Recommended Attribution

The images have a name, suppose the image name is _"image-x.png"_, by formatting the image name (removing the file extension, replacing "-" by one whitespace and capitalizing) we have that the formatted image name is _"Image X"_. Suppose that _Image X_ belongs to _Example Project XYZ_, the attribution notice goes as follows:

> "Example Project XYZ, Image X" by Tobias Briones is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. Available at
> https://github.com/TobiasBriones/images/tree/master/example-projects

Where you will replace _Example Project XYZ_ by the corresponding example project name [see the list above](https://github.com/TobiasBriones/images/blob/master/example-projects/README.md#example-projects) and _Image X_ by the formatted name of the image you are using.
