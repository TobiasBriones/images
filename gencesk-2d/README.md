### Recommended Attribution
The images have a name, suppose the image name is *"image-x.png"*, by formatting the image name (removing the file extension, replacing "-" by one whitespace and capitalizing) we have that the formatted image name is *"Image X"*. Since *Image X* belongs to *Gencesk 2D*, the attribution notice goes as follows:

> "Image X" by Tobias Briones is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. Available at
> https://github.com/TobiasBriones/images/tree/master/gencesk-2d

Where you will replace *Image X* by the formatted name of the image you are using.
