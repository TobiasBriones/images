### Recommended Attribution

The images have a name, suppose the image name is *"image-x.png"*, by formatting the image name
(removing the file extension, replacing "-" by one whitespace and capitalizing) we have that the
formatted image name is *"Image X"*. Since *Image X* belongs to *Gencesk 2D*, the attribution notice
goes as follows:

> "Image X" by Tobias Briones is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. Available at
> https://github.com/TobiasBriones/images/tree/main/gencesk-2d

Where you will replace *Image X* with the formatted name of the image you are using.
